Dear All,

I mounted an FTP site using GNOME Connect To Server.
But I cannot PUT any files over FTP to host.
It says: Error "Bad File Handle" while copying.
However I can GET files over FTP from host alright.

On Etch it works both ways, GET and PUT, only on Lenny I have got these
errors.

Would anyone see why?
Many thanks.
